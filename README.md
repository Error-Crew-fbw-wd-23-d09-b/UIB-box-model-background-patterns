# Background Patterns
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)

Let's create a simple page displaying a quote!
Two sets of patterns should surround the quote from top and bottom. The patterns are positioned in a certain way that the ones on the top are mirroring the ones at the bottom.

## Instructions
- Work in the files `index.html` and `styles.css`
- Scale the background image to achieve the desired look
- Scale it to lower than 40% to create the fine portion of the background
- Scale it to more than 100% to create the coarse part of the background

Take a look at the examples:

![Example Desktop](example-desktop.png)

![Example Mobile](example-mobile.png)

Take a look into the [blockquote](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote) element and make use of it.
